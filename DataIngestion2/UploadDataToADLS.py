# This code file should contain the code required to upload data to Azure Data Lake Storage.
# The problem should be able to run by the instructor using 'python ingestREST.py' (with their own API key).
# Store your key in a file with a .config appendix to avoid accidental check-in (.gitignore is setup to ignore .config)

# Assignment problems:
#   1a) Upload the PopulationWithPercentIncrease.csv file from the IngestKaggle.py problem to the storage account created 
#       for assignment 1.  Programmatically create a new container, assign-2, and a new directory,
#       upload-sample before uploading.
#   1b) Take a screenshot of the uploaded file in your storage account, showing the full path.
#   1c) Save the screenshot to the Data\Upload folder in git and push to GitHub.

# Points for this file: 10
