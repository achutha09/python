achutha09,3,Provide your perspective on how ND is doing with respect to CO2 emissions given the data above along with other insight you might have.,"I believe ND needs to improve in CO2 emissions as the state is at the average ranking of 23rd  in CO2 emissions. 
There should be some newer ideas and approaches that need to be taken by the state to reduce CO2 emissions.
By switching to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources, implementing cutting-edge carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, and adopting policies that are aimed at reducing emissions. By taking these steps, North Dakota can significantly lower its impact on global warming and advance the transition to a cleaner, more sustainable future."
